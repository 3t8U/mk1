Cascadia Psy Scouts Bio


“CascadiaPsyScouts is a collective of Psychedelic Trance enthusiasts dedicated to keeping psytrance psychedelic, underground, and in the forest! We are located in the Cascadia Bioregion and host an annual gathering called Portal Smashers. The gathering is intended to stimulate the deeper regions of the human experience and explore the outer realms of sound and light through music and samadhi dance.“


Do we need a mission statement? -Jon


We are the junkies of sound system culture?.....


“We are committed to supporting research and development of plant based medicine ability to heal physical and mental illness, and addiction.”


Crew
I think we should consider removing the crew names. Stay anonymous, plus it leaves too many people out, who aren’t on this list. 


* Monikers sounds good to me. Lets make sure we get links to all our creative sites though - nate
